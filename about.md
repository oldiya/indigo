I currently work as a  postdoc researcher at the University of Eastern Finland. My interests are data science, risk and management. I currently work on these issues from a forestry point of view  (forest dynamics, forest risk, forest modelling and forest biomass). I really enjoy the process of getting value from the data, look at the problem from a small and holistically scale and from different dimensions. This data driven interest has allow me to acquire solid statistical and programming skills, which I really enjoy using and keep learning about it.  I like to work in a multidisciplinary group, engage collaboratively with others, and be under the constant challenge of change: adapt to people, culture, new methods, new perspectives and new ways of doing things.  I have been lucky to experience this during my extensive international experience in research, teaching and project management, having worked in organizations such as IUFRO (Austria), US Forest Service (USA), Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (Sweden), University of Eastern Finland (Finland) and Polytechnic University of Madrid (Spain). I also have experience in science communication, I have been part of the summer science writing internship at the Oregon State University. In my free time I am a vice-member in my university department steering committee, I organise science events in bars, go hiking and dancing. I am also quite active in social media for professional and personal motivations, please look at the links at the bottom of this page if you want to connect.
