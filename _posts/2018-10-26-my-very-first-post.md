## Summary:

This post is a very light introduction to the collection of posts (a blog?)  that I am starting. 



## What is this about

This is a collection of posts (a blog?) without pretensions. I am mainly writing for myself about things that have been useful, are going to be useful or radiate usefulness. The topics mainly originate from my life, work and hobbies, so I guess you should expect a lot of R coding...

## What I am posting about? 

The topics that I am planning to talk about are not limited to: 

- Data science
- Forestry
- R
- Ecology
